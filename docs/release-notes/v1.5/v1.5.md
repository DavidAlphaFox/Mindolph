### New Features

* Theme Support for Mind Map
![v1.5-theme.png](v1.5-theme.png)
As of 1.5, the mind map editor now supports themes. Two new pre-defined themes `Light` and `Dark` are introduced, the old style has now become `Classic` theme. You can also custom your own theme by copying any existing theme(either pre-defined or custom).  
If you newly installed v1.5, the default Theme is `Light`; If you upgrad from an old version, a new custom theme called `default` will be created automatically with your previous style preferences.   
The style of connectors between topics now can choose new `Bezier` style or the classic `Polyline`(the only style in previous version), which can enhance the look of a mind map.
In the new version, the topic connector line is able to choose between the new `Bezier` style or the classic `Polyline` style, which can make mind maps look much better.

* Mind Map Embedded Image Preview and Resizing  

	A new preview and resizing dialog has been added for inserting images to mind map topics from clipboard or disk. You can scale image to the appropriate size for mind map topic. Once you have inserted the scaled image to a mind map, it can't be edited and resized again.
